# Employee Management System
This is a Java-based web application built using the Spring Boot framework and Thymeleaf templating. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee records. The application uses a MySQL database to store employee information, and the data is accessed and manipulated through Spring Data JPA.

<li>View Employees: Retrieve a list of all employees.
<li>View Employee Details: Display detailed information about a specific employee.
<li>Add Employee: Add a new employee to the system.
<li>Delete Employee: Remove an employee from the records.
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<li>Spring Boot: Backend framework for building Java-based applications.
<li>Thymeleaf: Server-side templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering.
<li>Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database operations using the Java Persistence API (JPA).
<li>MySQL: Database management system for storing employee data.
